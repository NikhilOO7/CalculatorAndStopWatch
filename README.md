# Calculator Web Application

This project is a simple calculator web application designed using jQuery and arrow functions. It has two pages, a Login Page, and a Calculator Page.

## Login Page

The Login Page contains four fields:

The page enforces the following validations:

- Null checks

- The email field only accepts northeastern.edu email addresses
- Displays error messages in red below the fields

Upon successful validation, the application redirects to the Calculator Page.

## Calculator Page

The Calculator Page includes two input fields for numbers and four operation buttons:

1. Add
2. Subtract
3. Multiply
4. Divide

The page enforces the following validations for the input fields:

- Only numbers are allowed
- Null checks
- Special character checks
- Infinite value checks
- Displays error messages in red below the fields

All four operations (Add, Subtract, Multiply, and Divide) are performed using a single arrow function.

Basic CSS is applied to both pages for improved styling.
